## Trial Summary
In both the greenhouse environment and growth chambers, LumiGrow researchers found that extending the photoperiod—while maintaining a constant daily light integral (DLI) between treatments—will promote the growth of lettuce (Lactuca sativa ‘Red Sails’ and L. sativa ‘Skyphos’; growth chamber results; greenhouse results). This confirms past research by Koontz and Prince (1986) revealing that lengthening the photoperiod from 16 to 24 hours while maintaining constant radiation, increased the fresh weight of several L. sativa varieties by 48 to 135%. 

This lengthened photoperiod, termed the “high-yield photoperiod”, could benefit growers by shortening production cycles, increasing yields per unit of energy consumed (g/Watt), and raising net profits. Lengthening the time in which supplemental fixtures radiate light—without increasing the overall DLI—may prove especially valuable to growers during winter months when there is minimal solar radiation.

Despite a replicable positive correlation between longer photoperiods and increased lettuce growth, the effect is not universal. When extending the photoperiod from 16- to 24-hours in summer greenhouse conditions (DLI: 19 mols*m-2*d-1), Dr. Ricardo Hernandez saw an increase in fresh weight and dry weight of Lactuca sativa ‘Skyphos’ and ‘Red Sails’ at transplant stage (14 days). Yet, he did not see this increase when harvesting at marketable weight (after 36 days).
 
Recently, LumiGrow found that L. sativa ‘Skyphos’ fresh and dry weights increased when extending the photoperiod in the greenhouse under excessive radiation (solar + supplemental DLI: >20 mols*m-2*d-1). Under the same conditions, L. sativa ‘Rex’ growth metrics did not increase in the extended photoperiod treatment. After repeating this experiment with lower light levels (solar + supplemental DLI ˜ 10 mols*m-2*d-1), LumiGrow research did not see an increase in the fresh weight, dry weight, or volume of ‘Rex’ or ‘Skyphos’.

In grow tents, LumiGrow research also found that three lettuce varieties (‘Bergam’s Green’, ‘Coastal Star’, and ‘Dragoon’) increased in fresh weight, dry weight, and volume as the photoperiod lengthened from 15 to 24 hours. This effect was most prominent after removing the variety effect from the analysis. However, after repeating this experiment by radiating ‘Bergam’s Green’ with either a 20- or 24-hour photoperiod, LumiGrow did not see a significant increase in lettuce fresh weight or volume. 

Factors influencing whether a study finds photoperiod extension to increase lettuce growth include: the lettuce variety, the difference in the photoperiod length between treatments, if the lighting is sole source or supplemental, whether the experiment occurs during winter or summer months, the daily light integral, and the method of propagation (including time-to-transplant, photoperiod length, and light intensity). In the experiments above, we suspect that differences in propagation influenced whether extending the photoperiod increased growth.

Lighting during propagation greatly affects subsequent plant growth. The petunia variety, ‘Tiny Tunia Violet Ice’ flowered 21 days earlier when the 16-day propagation phase DLI increased from 1.4 to 10.7 mols*m-2*d-1. The propagation DLI promoted early flowering, and this flowering did not depend on the DLI during the production phase (Lopez and Runkle, 2008). Johkan et al. (2010) found that at harvest the quality of light during 17-days of propagation modified L. sativa ‘Banchu Red Fire’ growth parameters, carotenoid, and chlorophyll content. We hypothesize that the propagation photoperiod substantially influences future plant growth and may be a critical component of the high-yield photoperiod effect. We predict that as the propagation photoperiod increases from 15 to 21 hours, time-to-harvestable lettuce size (150-200 grams) will decrease, even when lettuce plants experience the same DLI and photoperiod during the production phase.
